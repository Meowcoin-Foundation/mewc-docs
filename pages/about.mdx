# About Meowcoin

## The Meowcoin Project

Meowcoin is a blockchain project with a unique mission: to combine the power of cryptocurrency mining with tangible support for animal welfare worldwide. Founded on the principle that blockchain technology can be a force for positive change, Meowcoin allocates 40% of block rewards to support animal shelters and welfare organizations globally.

3. **Creating Utility**: Developing practical applications for blockchain in the animal sector, such as pet tokenization
