# Donations & Impact

## Our Philanthropic Mission

Meowcoin was founded with a core mission of supporting animal welfare globally. A portion (40%) of each block reward is automatically allocated to our donation fund, which is then distributed to animal shelters and welfare organizations worldwide.

This innovative approach combines the power of blockchain technology with tangible social impact, creating a cryptocurrency that not only provides value to miners and users but also makes a real difference in the lives of animals in need.

## How Meowcoin Supports Animal Welfare

Meowcoin's contribution to animal welfare is built directly into the blockchain:

1. **Automated Donations**: 40% of each block reward (5000 MEWC) goes to the community autonomous fund
2. **Regular Disbursements**: Weekly donations to various animal shelters and organizations
3. **Transparent Tracking**: All donations are publicly verifiable
4. **Global Reach**: Supporting organizations around the world
5. **Sustained Support**: Ongoing funding that organizations can count on
