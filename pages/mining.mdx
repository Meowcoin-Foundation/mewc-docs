# Mining Meowcoin

## Introduction to Meowcoin Mining

Meowcoin is a cryptocurrency that uses the **MeowPow algorithm**, a more energy-efficient fork of Ravencoin's KawPow. This algorithm is designed to be ASIC-resistant, allowing everyday GPU miners to participate in securing the network while mining profitably.

Mining Meowcoin not only provides financial rewards to miners but also contributes to animal welfare, as a portion of the block rewards supports animal shelters worldwide.

## MeowPow Algorithm

MeowPow is Meowcoin's custom mining algorithm that offers significant advantages:

- **Energy Efficiency**: Up to 60% more energy-efficient than comparable algorithms
- **ASIC Resistance**: Designed to be mined with consumer-grade GPUs
- **Decentralization**: Faster DAG growth rate (4x faster than networks like Ravencoin) ensures better decentralization
- **Environmental Sustainability**: Reduced power requirements mean a lower carbon footprint

TTMiner.exe -a MEOWPOW -p stratum+tcp://pool.example.com:8888 -u YOUR_MEOWCOIN_ADDRESS -p x
```

## Mining Tips & Best Practices

- Always check for the latest version of mining software on GitHub repositories
- MeowPow is fully supported within HiveOS, with integration for SRB Miner or TTMiner
- Join the [Meowcoin Discord](https://discord.com/invite/meowcoin) for community support and updates
- Monitor your GPU temperatures to ensure optimal performance and longevity
- Consider undervolting your GPUs to increase efficiency while mining
- Dual mining with MeowPow is possible using some miners and can increase profitability

## Mining and Environmental Responsibility

Meowcoin was designed with environmental concerns in mind. The MeowPow algorithm significantly reduces energy consumption compared to other PoW algorithms, making it a more sustainable choice for miners who care about their environmental impact.

By mining Meowcoin, you're not only earning cryptocurrency but also supporting a project that values efficiency and sustainability alongside its commitment to animal welfare.
