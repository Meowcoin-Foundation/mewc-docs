## Abstract
Meowcoin is a blockchain optimized for asset transfer between users with a community goal. It was originally built on the KAWPOW algorithm but has since transitioned to the **MeowPow algorithm** to enhance efficiency and better serve our mission. Intended for small-scale miners, Meowcoin aims to integrate blockchain technology in the animal sector, provide miners with a profitable blockchain to direct their hash power, and benefit the wider animal sector through philanthropic means. Meowcoin binds together the need for a financial future for miners and their desire to propagate the goodwill aims of a community into one project.

## Introduction
Cryptocurrency mining has often received poor representation in the media. Low reader comprehension on its importance and ESG policy have damaged its perception and presented it as an environment-killing, criminal-supporting endeavor. This could not be further from the truth.

With Ethereum moving to proof of stake imminently at the time of this document's writing, millions of GPU miners around the world are looking to shift into new projects to survive. Given the value mining provides to people living in countries with low incomes by comparison to most Western standards, there is sentiment that mining offers many an opportunity to generate financial freedom for those trying to escape poverty. These small-scale miners utilize cryptocurrency as a means of breaking out of their existing financial paradigm by trying something different from the traditional means of accruing wealth.

Many new projects have emerged to support the network. Meowcoin seeks to join these projects in offering an alternative blockchain to mine while also endeavoring to harness the goodwill miners have.

Research has shown the impact cats on the internet have had on people engaging with feline content. This positive correlation relates to the emotive feelings many have towards animals. There is additional research showing the general happiness and reduced stress of animal owners in contrast to those without animals. Animals play an important role in people's lives and positively impact humans’ general happiness and well-being.

With this as the background, Meowcoin looks to step in and engage with the positive impact of animals on people's lives as well as drive the adoption of blockchain in practical ways within the market.

## Tokenizing Pets
The evolution of blockchain technology moving from peer-to-peer electronic cash to include asset creation has seen seismic growth in the sector. Non-fungible token (NFT) popularization among the cryptocurrency community has seen incredible investment by mainstream customers who, for diverse reasons, saw NFTs as a great bridge to entry.

A great deal of discussions around the technology have taken place. Many have suggested they are fads, scams, or have no true real-world use case. Fair arguments could be made for the first and second, but the third—true real-world use case—is worth engaging in.

NFTs offer the highest level of electronic security possible. With proof-of-work (secured by the MeowPow algorithm) protecting the assets, the opportunity to store and provide digital assets available and traceable at all times without fear of theft provides a strong framework by which businesses can provide increased customer value.

It is fair to say the real challenge with asset and token technology is finding ways to implement it for valid reasons without alienating those who need to use it. Pet adoption is one of the opportunities to integrate blockchain technology that can benefit both animal shelters and adopters alike.

By tokenizing pets on the blockchain, important information regarding the asset can be lodged and made available for all to see. This includes:

- Address of owner
- Medical history
- Microchip number
- Animal lineage
- Animal pedigree papers

This information is important to the animal's ongoing well-being. Tokenizing adoption provides this information at the time of purchase and allows future pet owners (should that occur) to be aware of the pet's relevant information without needing to check with the previous owners or vet.

Additionally, it democratizes care of the animal independent of the vet as their medical history can be lodged on the blockchain, rather than a private database or server, to ensure all vets are able to access their records in times of need.

These details form the basis of the animal pedigree papers. While breeders place increased importance on these papers for show purposes, digitizing them allows traceability across multiple generations. Breeders would be able to easily access and determine future mating pairs further than three generations (industry standard) as well as work toward limiting congenital issues that persist through breeding lines.

Pet collars would be able to carry relevant and scannable tags that link to the information. This would assist in the returning of animals to owners should they run away from their homes.

Meowcoin is able to bridge this gap by providing a specialized tokenizing service for adoption shelters and breeders. This will allow registration of pets to take place easily and without fuss while allowing vets to tag the ongoing medical updates for a pet to create one cohesive and publicly accessible picture of the animal.

## Engaging with Rewards
Loyalty programs have long been a holy grail for marketers. It has been shown that customers using a loyalty program are 60% more likely to return and utilize that retailer. Enormous opportunity is available to retailers who engage with blockchain on rewards programs since coin is able to be dispersed and used across multiple avenues and with multiple redemption points.

By rewarding customers with cryptocurrency, retailers can offer consumers a benefit with high utility. Coins can be transferred throughout the ecosystem and put to use in new and interesting ways. These coins inevitably strengthen the entire ecosystem, which spurs innovation and opportunity.

With the size of the pet industry a staggering $232 billion USD, having a loyalty program run on a blockchain that consumers know supports the animals they love creates a positive feedback loop. This would be a compelling opportunity for pet companies to provide a philanthropic-based loyalty program while driving increased customer engagement.

Meowcoin can provide the framework on which a global pet retail loyalty scheme could be based.

## Philanthropy
Ultimately, support of the coin will also see charitable rewards. Part of the blockchain reward is held over by the administration of Meowcoin to provide financial donations to animal shelters. The ASPCA already provides cryptocurrency donation avenues, but other organizations are looking to engage with cryptocurrency as a means to receive philanthropic donations.

Small-scale miners by nature are philanthropic. When the Ukraine crisis began, an address for mining to donate to Ukraine was created. A total of 10,207 ETH at the time of writing has been sent to this address to aid Ukraine—a large portion of it was mined.

By providing a financial reward for mining the blockchain while knowing their efforts aid philanthropic means for animals, Meowcoin provides a "have your cake and eat it too" facility that helps miners feel good about what they’re doing.

Roadmaps for projects are inevitably flawed from the beginning because they exist on the premise that authors can see into the future. And in this fashion, we point the torch as far as it can be seen.

Inevitably, we believe Meowcoin will take the community to places it never imagined it would go. Our role is to provide the framework and the emotional support for people to mold and evolve with the changes that might take place as it grows.

We extend an invitation to all miners to join us and hold the torch; together, we forge a stronger path than we could ever imagine.

## Conclusion
Meowcoin is a platform built on the MeowPow algorithm and forked from the Neoxa project—this in turn was an evolution from Ravencoin, which finds its genesis in Bitcoin. We stand on the shoulders of others and acknowledge their efforts while respectfully looking to pave our own way.

It will serve as the basis for miners to step forward into a post-Ethereum ecosystem in a project that has philanthropy at its core. The statement "by miners, with miners, for miners" is an apt embodiment of our project. But miners, as people, live in community with others and understand the benefit it can provide to the wider world. It is with eyes firmly set on this aim that we secure the blockchain together.

All communities have at their core a reason for being. As lovers of cats, we believed our feline friends provided an opportunity for people to rally around; something people can gather around while remaining uniquely independent culturally. We note cats have been a rallying point—of sorts—dating back millennia to the Ancient Egyptians. While they did not worship cats, they did believe that cats were representative of fertility, domesticity, music, dance, and pleasure; the Egyptians embraced and revered them accordingly. We hold to the sentiment of the Ancients and reach out our hand to all miners to add one further element that cats can represent to us—unity in decentralization.
